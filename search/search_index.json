It's aim is to be powerful with a simple and intuitive user experience. Goals \u00b6 The primary goals for dexplot are: Maintain a very consistent API with as few functions as necessary to make the desired statistical plots Allow the user to tweak the plots without digging into matplotlib Installation \u00b6 pip install dexplot Built for long and wide data \u00b6 Dexplot is primarily built for long data, which is a form of data where each row represents a single observation and each column represents a distinct quantity. It is often referred to as \"tidy\" data. Dexplot also has the ability to handle wide data, where multiple columns may contain values that represent the same kind of quantity. Usage \u00b6 Dexplot provides a small number of powerful functions that all work similarly. Most plotting functions have the following signature: dxp . plotting_func ( x , y , data , aggfunc , split , row , col , orientation , ... ) x - Column name along the x-axis y - Column name the y-axis data - Pandas DataFrame aggfunc - String of pandas aggregation function, 'min', 'max', 'mean', etc... split - Column name to split data into distinct groups row - Column name to split data into distinct subplots row-wise col - Column name to split data into distinct subplots column-wise orientation - Either vertical ( 'v' ) or horizontal ( 'h' ). Default for most plots is vertical. When aggfunc is provided, x will be the grouping variable and y will be aggregated when vertical and vice-versa when horizontal. The best way to learn how to use dexplot is with the examples below. Comparison with Seaborn \u00b6 If you have used the seaborn library, then you should notice a lot of similarities. Much of Dexplot was inspired by Seaborn. Below is a list of the extra features in dexplot not found in seaborn The ability to graph relative frequency percentage and normalize over any number of variables Far fewer public functions No need for multiple functions to do the same thing Ability to make grids with a single function instead of having to use a higher level function like catplot Pandas groupby methods are available as strings Ability to sort by values Ability to sort x/y labels lexicographically Both x/y-labels and titles are automatically wrapped so that they don't overlap The figure size (plus several other options) and available to change without using matplotlib Only matplotlib objects are returned Examples \u00b6 Most of the examples below use long data. Bar Charts \u00b6 The examples come from the Airbnb dataset, which contains many property rental listings from the Washington D.C. area. % load_ext autoreload % autoreload 2 import dexplot as dxp import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt pd . set_option ( 'display.max_columns' , None ) airbnb = dxp . load_dataset ( 'airbnb' ) airbnb . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } neighborhood property_type accommodates bathrooms bedrooms price cleaning_fee rating superhost response_time latitude longitude 0 Shaw Townhouse 16 3.5 4 433 250 95.0 No within an hour 38.90982 -77.02016 1 Brightwood Park Townhouse 4 3.5 4 154 50 97.0 No NaN 38.95888 -77.02554 2 Capitol Hill House 2 1.5 1 83 35 97.0 Yes within an hour 38.88791 -76.99668 3 Shaw House 2 2.5 1 475 0 98.0 No NaN 38.91331 -77.02436 4 Kalorama Heights Apartment 3 1.0 1 118 15 91.0 No within an hour 38.91933 -77.04124 There are nearly 5,000 listings in our dataset. We will use bar charts to aggregate the data. airbnb . shape (4902, 12) Vertical bar charts \u00b6 In order to performa an aggregation, you must supply a value for aggfunc . Here, we find the median price per neighborhood. Notice that the column names automatically wrap. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' ) Components of the groupby aggregation \u00b6 Anytime the aggfunc parameter is set, you have performed a groupby aggregation, which always consists of three components: Grouping column - unique values of this column form independent groups (neighborhood) Aggregating column - the column that will get summarized with a single value (price) Aggregating function - a function that returns a single value (median) The general format for doing this in pandas is: df . groupby ( 'grouping column' ) . agg ({ 'aggregating column' : 'aggregating function' }) Specifically, the following code is executed within dexplot. airbnb . groupby ( 'neighborhood' ) . agg ({ 'price' : 'median' }) .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } price neighborhood Brightwood Park 90.0 Capitol Hill 140.0 Columbia Heights 99.0 Dupont Circle 130.0 Edgewood 100.0 Kalorama Heights 119.0 Shaw 140.0 Union Station 128.5 Sorting the bars \u00b6 By default, the grouping column (x-axis here) will be sorted in alphabetical order. Use the sort parameter to specify how its sorted. lex_asc - sort lexicographically A to Z (default) lex_desc - sort lexicographically Z to A asc - sort values from least to greatest desc - sort values from greatest to least None - Use order of appearance in DataFrame fig = dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , sort = 'lex_desc' ) fig dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , sort = 'asc' ) Specify order with x_order \u00b6 Specify a specific order of the values on the x-axis by passing a list of values to x_order . This can also act as a filter to limit the number of bars. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , x_order = [ 'Dupont Circle' , 'Edgewood' , 'Union Station' ]) Horizontal bars \u00b6 Set orientation to 'h' for horizontal bars. When you do this, you'll need to switch x and y since the grouping column (neighborhood) will be along the y-axis and the aggregating column (price) will be along the x-axis. dxp . bar ( x = 'price' , y = 'neighborhood' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , orientation = 'h' ) Split bars into groups \u00b6 You can split each bar into further groups by setting the split parameter to another column. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'superhost' ) We can use the pivot_table method to replicate the results in pandas. airbnb . pivot_table ( index = 'neighborhood' , columns = 'superhost' , values = 'price' , aggfunc = 'median' ) .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } superhost No Yes neighborhood Brightwood Park 90 90 Capitol Hill 150 135 Columbia Heights 95 105 Dupont Circle 125 139 Edgewood 105 100 Kalorama Heights 115 124 Shaw 149 139 Union Station 130 125 Set the order of the unique split values with split_order , which can also act as a filter. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'superhost' , split_order = [ 'Yes' , 'No' ]) Stacked bar charts \u00b6 Stack all the split groups one on top of the other by setting stacked to True . dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'superhost' , split_order = [ 'Yes' , 'No' ], stacked = True ) Split into multiple plots \u00b6 It's possible to split the data further into separate plots by the unique values in a different column with the row or col parameter. Here, each kind of property_type has its own plot. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'superhost' , col = 'property_type' ) If there isn't room for all of the plots, set the wrap parameter to an integer to set the maximum number of plots per row/col. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'superhost' , col = 'property_type' , wrap = 2 ) Use col_order to both filter and set a specific order for the plots. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'superhost' , col = 'property_type' , col_order = [ 'House' , 'Condominium' ]) Splits can be made simultaneously along row and columns. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'superhost' , col = 'property_type' , col_order = [ 'House' , 'Condominium' , 'Apartment' ], row = 'bedrooms' , row_order = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ]) Set the width of each bar with size \u00b6 The width of the bars is set with the size parameter. dxp . bar ( x = 'neighborhood' , y = 'price' , data = airbnb , aggfunc = 'median' , split = 'property_type' , split_order = [ 'Apartment' , 'House' ], x_order = [ 'Dupont Circle' , 'Capitol Hill' ], size =. 5 )","title":"Home"},{"location":"#dexplot","text":"Dexplot is a Python library for delivering beautiful data visualizations.
